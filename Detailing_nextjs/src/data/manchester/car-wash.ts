      body: 'Automated car washes use rotating brushes that cause swirl marks and fine scratches over time. Our mobile hand car wash uses the safe two-bucket method — a dedicated wash bucket and a rinse bucket — to lift and remove dirt without dragging it across your paintwork. Every wash is carried out by a trained detailer, not a machine. We cover the whole of Greater Manchester, from the city centre to Sale, Altrincham, Didsbury, Trafford, Salford, and beyond.',
