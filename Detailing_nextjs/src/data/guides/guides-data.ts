Unlike a regular car wash, which simply removes surface dirt, detailing involves paint correction (machine polishing to remove scratches and swirl marks), protective coating application (ceramic coating, wax, or sealant), and deep interior restoration. The goal is to return the vehicle to — or exceed — its original showroom condition.',

        body: 'Car detailing and car valeting are often confused, but they serve different purposes. Valeting is professional cleaning — it makes your car clean and fresh. Detailing is restoration and protection — it corrects paint defects and applies long-term coatings. Think of valeting as regular maintenance (monthly) and detailing as specialist treatment (annually). Most car owners benefit from a combination of both.',

        body: 'Professional car detailing prices vary significantly based on the services included. A single-stage paint correction typically starts from £250, while a full detail with multi-stage correction and ceramic coating can range from £500 to £1,500+. The final price depends on vehicle size, paint condition, and the level of protection chosen. Interior-only detailing starts from around £150.',

        heading: 'How Often Should You Detail Your Car?',
        body: 'For most vehicles, a full exterior detail once or twice a year is sufficient. If you have a ceramic coating, annual maintenance detailing keeps the coating performing optimally. Between details, regular valeting (monthly or quarterly) maintains the appearance. Vehicles exposed to harsh conditions — winter driving, long commutes, tree-heavy parking areas — may benefit from more frequent attention.',

        question: 'Is car detailing worth it?',
        answer: 'Yes. Professional detailing protects your paintwork from environmental damage, maintains resale value, and keeps your car looking its best. A ceramic-coated vehicle is easier and cheaper to maintain long-term than an unprotected one.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I detail my car myself?',
        answer: 'Basic maintenance is possible, but paint correction and ceramic coating require professional equipment, training and experience. Incorrect machine polishing can burn through clear coat permanently. Professional detailing is always recommended for correction and coating work.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How long does car detailing take?',
        answer: 'A full exterior detail takes 6–10 hours. Interior detailing takes 3–5 hours. A complete detail covering both can take 1–2 days depending on the vehicle\'s size and condition.',
