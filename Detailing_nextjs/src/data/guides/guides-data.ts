        body: 'PPF (paint protection film) and ceramic coating protect your paint in fundamentally different ways. PPF is a physical barrier — a clear thermoplastic urethane film that absorbs stone chips, scratches, and impacts. Ceramic coating is a chemical barrier — a liquid-applied nano-coating that protects against UV, chemicals, and environmental damage. They address different threats and work best in combination.',

        question: 'How much does PPF cost compared to ceramic coating?',
        answer: 'Full front-end PPF (bumper, bonnet, wings) typically costs £800–£1,500. A full vehicle PPF wrap costs £3,000–£6,000. Ceramic coating for the full vehicle costs £400–£1,000. Many customers choose partial PPF plus full ceramic as the best value combination.',

      {
        question: 'Can you put ceramic coating on top of PPF?',
        answer: 'Yes, and it is recommended. Ceramic coating over PPF enhances hydrophobic properties, makes the film easier to clean, and adds UV protection to prevent the PPF from yellowing over time.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Do I need PPF if I have ceramic coating?',
        answer: 'Ceramic coating does not protect against stone chips or physical impact. If you drive on motorways or country roads where stone chips are a risk, PPF on the front end is a worthwhile addition. For city-only driving, ceramic coating alone may be sufficient.',

        body: 'Clay bar treatment is a decontamination process that removes bonded surface contaminants that regular washing cannot shift. These contaminants — iron particles from brake dust, industrial fallout, rail dust, tree sap residue, and overspray — physically bond to your paint\'s clear coat. A clay bar or clay mitt physically pulls these particles from the surface, leaving the paint glass-smooth and ready for polishing or protection.',

        body: 'After washing and drying your car, put your hand inside a thin plastic bag (like a sandwich bag) and run your fingertips across the paint. The bag amplifies texture — if the surface feels rough, gritty, or bumpy, your paint has bonded contamination and needs clay barring. If it feels glass-smooth, the surface is clean. Most daily-driven cars in Manchester will feel rough after just 2–3 months between treatments.',

        question: 'How often should I clay bar my car?',
        answer: 'Every 3–6 months for daily-driven vehicles, or whenever the bag test reveals a rough surface. Cars parked near railways or industrial areas may need more frequent treatment. Ceramic-coated cars require clay barring less frequently.',

      {
        question: 'Can clay barring scratch my paint?',
        answer: 'If used with insufficient lubrication, yes — clay can cause light marring (very fine scratches). Always use generous amounts of clay lubricant and light pressure. Any light marring from clay barring is easily removed with a finishing polish.',

      {
        question: 'Do I need to polish after clay barring?',
        answer: 'Clay barring can leave light marring on the surface. If you plan to apply a coating or sealant, a light finishing polish after clay barring ensures a defect-free base. If you are just maintaining the car between details, the marring from clay is usually invisible to the naked eye.',
