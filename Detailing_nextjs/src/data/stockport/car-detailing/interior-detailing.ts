        'Interior detailing is a comprehensive, professional-grade restoration of every surface inside your vehicle — going far beyond what a standard interior valet achieves. While an interior valet cleans surfaces, interior detailing restores them. We use commercial steam cleaners to sanitise and deep-clean fabric, hot water extraction machines to remove staining embedded throughout the upholstery pile, specialist leather cleaners and conditioners to treat and protect hide, and UV-C sanitisation to eliminate bacteria, allergens, and mould spores at a level surface cleaning cannot achieve. The result is a cabin that looks, feels, and smells genuinely restored — not just cleaned.',
        'Interior detailing uses equipment and techniques that are simply not available in household cleaning. A professional hot water extraction machine operates at temperatures and pressures that drive cleaning solution deep into fabric fibres and then extract it along with dissolved contamination — leaving fabric clean throughout its depth rather than just at the surface. Commercial steam cleaners produce superheated steam at temperatures that kill bacteria and mould spores on contact. These are not domestic appliances applied to a vehicle — they are purpose-built professional tools that produce categorically different results.',

      heading: 'Why Stockport Interiors Need Professional Restoration',
      bodyParagraphs: [
        "Stockport's consistently wet climate creates interior contamination at a rate and depth that surface cleaning cannot address. Mud and moisture tracked in from country walks at Woodbank Park, Reddish Vale, Lyme Park, and the Goyt Valley transfers significant organic material into carpet pile — material that stays moist under floor mats, promoting bacteria and mould growth. The distinctive musty smell of many older vehicles in Greater Manchester is primarily this sub-mat bacterial environment, not surface dirt.",
        "Family and pet vehicles across Bramhall, Cheadle Hulme, Hazel Grove, and Marple accumulate layers of food residue, pet dander, bacteria, and deeply embedded grime in seat upholstery that years of vacuuming and surface spray have not reached. For daily commuters spending significant time in their vehicles on the A6, M60, or A560 corridors, the interior environment also matters for wellbeing — a bacteria-laden, damp-smelling cabin is a practical health concern, not just a cosmetic one. Professional interior detailing addresses the problem thoroughly, with equipment and techniques that actually achieve what household cleaning products cannot.",

      question: 'How long does interior detailing take in Stockport?',
      answer:
        'A full interior detail takes 3–5 hours for a standard hatchback or saloon. Larger vehicles — SUVs, estates, and 7-seaters — typically take 4–6 hours. Heavily contaminated interiors or those requiring extensive stain treatment may require additional time or a follow-up visit. We always give an honest assessment before starting.',

    {
      question: 'What is the difference between interior valeting and interior detailing?',
      answer:
        'Interior valeting is a thorough cleaning service covering all surfaces. Interior detailing adds restoration-grade techniques: hot water extraction for deep upholstery recovery, steam sanitisation, professional leather conditioning and protection, UV-C sanitisation for bacteria and allergens, and ozone treatment for persistent odours. Detailing is restoration; valeting is maintenance.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can interior detailing remove deep-set stains?',
      answer:
        'Hot water extraction resolves the majority of embedded stains including coffee, food, mud, juice, and most liquid spills. Very old or chemically fixed stains — certain inks, bleach damage, permanent dye transfer — may not come out completely. We assess each vehicle before starting and give an honest expectation of results.',

    {
      question: 'Can you remove pet hair during an interior detail?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Our interior detail includes professional vacuuming and rubber agitation tools for pet hair removal, followed by extraction to address the organic contamination pet hair leaves in fabric. For very heavily infested vehicles, our dedicated pet hair removal service is recommended as a standalone or combined appointment.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How much does interior detailing cost in Stockport?',
      answer:
        'Interior detailing starts from £150 for a standard hatchback. Larger vehicles — SUVs, 7-seaters — from £180–£200. Heavily contaminated interiors or those requiring leather restoration and ozone treatment are priced accordingly. Contact us for an exact quote.',
