      bodyParagraphs: [
        'Modern headlight lenses are made from polycarbonate plastic — lightweight and impact-resistant, but susceptible to UV degradation. From new, the lens is coated with a thin UV-protective lacquer. Over time — typically 4 to 8 years depending on the vehicle\'s exposure — this lacquer degrades and separates, allowing UV radiation to begin oxidising the polycarbonate beneath. The result is the characteristic yellowing, hazing, and surface crazing visible on countless vehicles across Stockport.',
        "Greater Manchester's climate — persistent cloud and diffuse UV, combined with periods of direct summer sunshine — creates conditions that accelerate this degradation more than you might expect. Vehicles parked on open driveways or in uncovered car parks face constant UV exposure. The orange or amber tint that develops is not a cosmetic issue alone: oxidised headlights reduce light output to the road surface by up to 80%, significantly reducing your ability to see and be seen at night. This is a direct road safety concern — and one that MOT testers increasingly note as an advisory or failure point.",

        'Pre-clean — headlight lenses cleaned and degreased; surrounding paintwork masked off to protect from abrasive stages',
        'Wet sanding — progressive grit sequence starting at 400 to remove all degraded lacquer and deep oxidation, stepping through 800, 1500 and 2000 grit to refine the surface',
        'Machine polishing — dual-action polisher with cutting compound removes sanding marks and restores optical clarity to the polycarbonate',
        'Finishing polish — fine finishing compound maximises clarity and surface smoothness',
        'IPA wipe — surface cleaned and degreased to ensure clean adhesion for sealant',
        'UV sealant application — specialist headlight UV sealant applied in multiple thin coats, forming a new protective barrier against future oxidation',

      items: [
        'Restores light output — oxidised lenses reduce beam effectiveness by up to 80%; restoration returns near-original output levels',
        'Improved road safety — clearer lenses mean better visibility at night and in Stockport\'s frequent overcast conditions',
        'MOT compliance — foggy headlights are increasingly noted as advisories or failures; restoration resolves this without lens replacement',
        'Cost saving — professional restoration costs a fraction of OEM or aftermarket lens replacement (typically £200–£600+ for a new pair)',
        'Improved appearance — yellowed headlights age a vehicle significantly; clear lenses restore a cleaner, newer look',
        'UV sealant prevents rapid re-oxidation — without sealant, polycarbonate re-oxidises within weeks; our sealed result lasts 2–3 years',

      body: "Our headlight restoration service is fully mobile — all equipment carried to your Stockport driveway, workplace, or any accessible location. No need to book into a garage or wait for a scheduled service slot. We cover all SK postcodes from our Dukinfield base including Bramhall, Cheadle, Hazel Grove, Marple, Heaton Moor, Reddish, and Stockport town centre. The service typically takes 1–2 hours per pair and can be combined with any other valeting or detailing service on the same visit.",

  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'How much does headlight restoration cost in Stockport?',
      answer:
        'From £60 per pair for standard headlights. Severely oxidised lenses with deep crazing may take longer and be priced accordingly. Contact us for a quote — we are locally based and can often book at short notice.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long do the results last?',
      answer:
        'With UV sealant applied, results typically last 2–3 years before the first signs of re-oxidation appear. With ceramic coating protection (available as an upgrade), longevity extends further. Without sealant — which we always apply — polycarbonate would begin re-oxidising within weeks.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can headlights be fully restored even if very yellow?',
      answer:
        'In most cases, yes. Even severely oxidised lenses that appear deeply yellowed can be restored to good clarity through wet sanding, as we remove all degraded material and expose fresh polycarbonate beneath. Lenses with deep internal crazing (crazing beneath the surface that cannot be sanded out) or physical cracks cannot be restored — we assess and advise before starting.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will headlight restoration help my car pass its MOT?',
      answer:
        'Yes, if the failure or advisory relates to poor headlight clarity or light output. MOT testers assess headlights for aim and output — heavily oxidised lenses reduce output significantly. Restoration improves output and removes the visual indicator of deterioration. If headlights are failing purely due to aim, that is a separate adjustment issue we can flag.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can you restore headlights at my home in Stockport?',
      answer:
        'Yes. All equipment — sanding pads, machine polisher, compounds, and UV sealant — is mobile. We come to your driveway across all SK postcodes. The service takes 1–2 hours and can be combined with other services on the same visit.',
