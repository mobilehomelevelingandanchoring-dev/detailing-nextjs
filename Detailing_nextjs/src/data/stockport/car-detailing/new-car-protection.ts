      bodyParagraphs: [
        'New paintwork is not automatically protected. Factory paint consists of a primer layer, base colour coat, and a clear coat — typically 40–60 microns thick. That clear coat is the outer protective layer, and from the moment your vehicle leaves the dealership, it begins accumulating contamination. The first drive home exposes it to road salt, iron fallout from brake dust and rail crossings, traffic film, and UV radiation. Without a ceramic coating or sealant, these begin chemically interacting with the clear coat surface immediately.',
        'New vehicles are also the ideal candidates for ceramic coating for a different reason: the paint is in perfect condition. There are no swirl marks from car washes, no water spot etching, no oxidation. This means the preparation stage is minimal — typically decontamination, a thorough paint inspection for any dealer-inflicted marring or buffer trails, and a light polish if needed — and the coating bonds to a flawless, defect-free surface. Coating a new car takes less time and costs less than coating a vehicle that first needs significant paint correction.',
        "Dealer-offered 'paint protection' should be approached with caution. Dealership paint protection packages are frequently an overpriced general sealant applied by non-specialist staff — occasionally not applied at all, with the certificate issued regardless. A ceramic coating from a specialist detailer is a fundamentally different product: chemically bonded SiO2, professionally applied with controlled panel wipes, flash times, and levelling — not a spray-on sealant from a bottle.",

        "Greater Manchester's rainfall keeps road salt and contamination in a mobile, chemically active state — constant low-level attack on unprotected paint",
        'Automated dealer and valet centre washes introduce swirl marks from the first clean — a coated surface is significantly more resistant',
        'UV degradation of unprotected clear coat begins immediately and is cumulative — early protection halts this from day one',

      heading: 'When to Book New Car Protection',
      body: "Ideally within the first two weeks of taking delivery — before the paint accumulates any defects that require correction. The longer you wait, the more the condition of the paint degrades from road salt, automated washes, and UV exposure, and the more preparation work is required before coating. We recommend booking as soon as your collection date is confirmed so we can schedule the service in the days immediately following delivery across your Stockport location.",
    },

  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'How soon after buying should I protect my new car?',
      answer:
        'Ideally within the first 1–2 weeks of delivery. The sooner the better — paint condition is at its best and coating preparation is minimal. Book as soon as your collection date is confirmed so we can schedule promptly.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is dealer paint protection worth it?',
      answer:
        "Dealer 'paint protection' is typically a general sealant applied with minimal preparation — not a chemically bonded ceramic coating. It provides limited protection and poor value. A professional ceramic coating from a specialist provides far superior and longer-lasting protection. If you have already paid for dealer paint protection, we can advise on complementing or replacing it.",

    {
      question: 'How much does new car protection cost in Stockport?',
      answer:
        'New car protection with entry-level ceramic coating from £300. Mid-range (3–4 year) packages from £500. Premium (5–7+ year) from £800. Pricing varies by vehicle size and included add-ons. New vehicles require less preparation than used cars, which keeps costs lower.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need paint correction on a brand new car?',
      answer:
        'Not always — but sometimes. Dealer preparation often involves automated showroom washes that introduce light swirl marks, and buffer trails from aggressive dealer polishing are not uncommon. We inspect every vehicle under specialist lighting before coating and correct any defects found, included in the service.',

    {
      question: 'Can you come to my home to protect my new car in Stockport?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Our fully mobile unit covers all SK postcodes. We bring all equipment needed including panel inspection lighting, machine polisher for any required correction, and all coating products. A covered or shaded area is preferable during application — we advise on setup when booking.',
