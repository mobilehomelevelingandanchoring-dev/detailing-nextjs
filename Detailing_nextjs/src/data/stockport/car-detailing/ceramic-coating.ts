      bodyParagraphs: [
        'A ceramic coating is a liquid polymer — typically SiO2 (silicon dioxide) or a blend of SiO2 and TiO2 — applied to a vehicle\'s clear coat, where it chemically bonds to form a semi-permanent protective layer. Unlike a wax or paint sealant that sits on top of the surface and degrades within months, a ceramic coating becomes part of the paint surface itself. The result is a hard, slick, hydrophobic shell that repels water, contaminants, and UV radiation for years rather than weeks.',
        'The hydrophobic effect — water sheeting off in tight beads rather than spreading across the panel — is the most visible property of a ceramic coating, but it is the chemical resistance that provides the most meaningful long-term protection. Road salt, bird dropping acid, industrial fallout, tree sap, and brake dust all have a significantly reduced ability to bond or etch into a ceramic-coated surface compared to bare or wax-protected paint. For Stockport vehicles exposed to Greater Manchester\'s wet climate, winter road salting, and the iron-rich air corridor of the M60, this protective performance is directly valuable.',
        'Ceramic coatings do not prevent all damage. They will not stop stone chips, deep scratches, or significant physical impact. But they do reduce the rate of contamination bonding, make washing easier and less damaging, and maintain the paint\'s appearance between professional cleans far more effectively than any traditional product.',

        "Greater Manchester's 800mm+ annual rainfall creates persistent water spotting on unprotected paint — hydrophobic coating causes water to sheet off and take contaminants with it",
        'Tree sap and organic deposits from the canopy-lined streets of Bramhall, Cheadle Hulme, and Marple bond quickly to bare paint — coating prevents adhesion',
        'Iron fallout from the M60/M56 junction corridor and rail crossings deposits onto paint — chemical resistance keeps surfaces clean between washes',
        'UV radiation degrades unprotected clear coat over time, causing oxidation and fading — SiO2 coatings include UV inhibitors that slow this process',

      question: 'What is ceramic coating and how does it work?',
      answer:
        'A ceramic coating is an SiO2-based liquid polymer that chemically bonds to your clear coat, forming a semi-permanent hard, hydrophobic layer. It repels water, resists chemical contamination, and blocks UV radiation — protecting your paint for years rather than weeks. Unlike wax, it does not wash off with shampoo.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Does my car need paint correction before ceramic coating?',
      answer:
        'Yes — always. A ceramic coating locks in whatever is on the paint surface. Applying a coating over swirl marks, scratches, or oxidation permanently seals those defects. All our ceramic coating packages include at minimum a single-stage paint correction to ensure the surface is defect-free before coating.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does ceramic coating last in Stockport?',
      answer:
        'Our packages range from 2-year entry level to 7+ year premium coatings. Longevity depends on the product tier and how the vehicle is maintained. Regular pH-neutral washing and avoiding automatic car washes significantly extends coating life. Greater Manchester\'s wet climate actually helps — water sheeting off the coating keeps the surface cleaner between washes.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will ceramic coating prevent scratches?',
      answer:
        'A ceramic coating adds hardness to the surface and offers resistance to light swirling and fine wash marks. It will not prevent stone chips or deep scratches from physical impacts. For scratch protection, paint protection film (PPF) is the appropriate product — we can advise on combined PPF and ceramic coating packages.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How much does ceramic coating cost in Stockport?',
      answer:
        'Packages start from £300 for a 2-year entry-level coating including decontamination and single-stage correction. Mid-range (3–4 years) from £500. Premium (5–7+ years) from £800. Exact price depends on vehicle size and paint condition — contact us for a quote.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can you apply ceramic coating at my home in Stockport?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Our mobile unit carries professional panel lighting, all application equipment, and climate-controlled application conditions. We work on driveways across all SK postcodes. A covered or sheltered space is preferable during application — we assess the environment on arrival and advise if conditions are unsuitable.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does a ceramic coating take to apply?',
      answer:
        'A full ceramic coating service including decontamination, paint correction, and coating application typically takes 1–2 days. The coating itself requires 24–48 hours dry cure time before the vehicle can be exposed to water. We schedule around your requirements and keep you informed at every stage.',
