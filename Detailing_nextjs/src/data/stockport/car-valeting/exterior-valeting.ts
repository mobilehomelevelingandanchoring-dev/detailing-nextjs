      bodyParagraphs: [
        'Exterior car valeting is a professional cleaning and protection service focused entirely on the outside of your vehicle — the bodywork, wheels, tyres, glass, and trim. Unlike a quick drive-through car wash, a professional exterior valet is a systematic, contact-safe process that removes road grime, brake dust, iron contamination, and organic deposits without scratching or degrading the paintwork.',
        'The key distinction between professional exterior valeting and a self-service jet wash is technique and chemistry. We use pH-neutral shampoos that do not strip existing paint protection layers, microfibre wash mitts that hold dirt away from the paint surface, and a two-bucket system that ensures clean solution is always used. The result is a genuinely cleaner vehicle with intact paintwork — not one that looks clean but has been scratched by hard brushes and harsh detergents.',
        'Exterior valeting in Stockport is also distinct from exterior detailing. Valeting is a maintenance service — it cleans and protects. Exterior detailing goes further by correcting paint defects such as swirl marks and oxidation through machine polishing. For most vehicles, regular exterior valeting is the correct routine maintenance, with detailing applied periodically for deeper restoration.',

        'Pressure rinse: the snow foam and suspended contaminants are fully flushed from all panels, door shuts, and wheel arches',
        'Two-bucket hand wash: clean microfibre wash mitts are used panel by panel from the roof down, with spent solution discharged into a dedicated rinse bucket fitted with a grit guard',
        'Wheel decontamination: iron fallout remover spray is applied to alloy wheels, reacts visibly with embedded brake dust, and is agitated with multiple dedicated wheel brushes before rinsing',
        'Tar spot removal: stubborn bitumen deposits on lower panels are dissolved with a dedicated tar remover and wiped clean without scratching',
        'Final rinse and microfibre drying: all panels are rinsed thoroughly and dried immediately with large, plush microfibre drying towels — no chamois leather that traps grit',

      heading: 'Why Stockport\'s Roads Demand Regular Exterior Valeting',
      bodyParagraphs: [
        'Stockport\'s road network creates unusually aggressive paint contamination conditions. The A6 (Manchester to Stockport corridor), the M60 motorway through Cheadle, and the A560 (Cheadle Hulme link road) all carry high volumes of diesel commercial traffic. Exhaust particulate, road oil, and iron fallout from rail crossings deposit onto paintwork on every journey, and the grey film of traffic contamination is visible within a week of washing on most vehicles used for regular commuting.',
        'From October through to March, the Stockport Borough gritting programme treats all principal routes including the A6, A34, A560, and major residential access roads across SK1 through SK12. Sodium chloride road salt migrates into wheel arches, door sill voids, and onto lower body panels on every journey. Professional exterior valeting that removes this salt before it compounds across successive winter weeks directly reduces the rate of lacquer degradation, alloy wheel corrosion, and brake component wear.',
        'The semi-rural residential areas of Bramhall (SK7), Cheadle Hulme (SK8), and Marple (SK6) present a different challenge: tree canopy contamination. Oak, lime, and sycamore trees deposit sap, honeydew, and pollen across parked vehicles from April through October. These organic compounds are mildly acidic and, when left on paintwork through repeated wet-dry cycles, cause micro-etching that dulls the finish. Regular exterior valeting removes these deposits before they cure and become much harder to clean safely.',

      question: 'How long does an exterior valet take in Stockport?',
      answer: 'A standard exterior valet takes 1 to 1.5 hours for a hatchback or saloon, 1.5 to 2 hours for a large estate, SUV, or van. We always give a clear time estimate when booking so you can plan your schedule.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is a hand car wash safer than an automated car wash for my paint?',
      answer: 'Yes — significantly. Automated car washes with rotating brushes are the single largest cause of wash-induced swirl marks across the UK. The brushes pick up and retain grit from previous vehicles, which is then dragged across your clear coat. Our two-bucket hand wash method uses clean mitts on clean paint every time, eliminating this risk. The difference is visible on dark cars in direct sunlight.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you use my water and electricity?',
      answer: 'No. Our mobile unit is fully self-contained with its own fresh water supply and power generator. We need nothing from your property except access to your vehicle.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is included in an exterior valet vs a full valet?',
      answer: 'An exterior valet covers everything on the outside — pre-wash, hand wash, wheel decontamination, drying, wax protection, and glass clean. A full valet adds a comprehensive interior clean: vacuum, upholstery wipe, dashboard and trim cleaning, and interior glass. For customers who just need the outside done quickly, an exterior valet is the right choice.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How often should I get my car exterior valeted in Stockport?',
      answer: 'For most Stockport drivers, every 3 to 6 weeks is ideal for maintaining clean paintwork and removing active contamination before it causes damage. Vehicles used daily on the A6 or M60 corridor, or parked under trees in Bramhall or Marple, benefit from more frequent cleaning — every 2 to 3 weeks during autumn and winter.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can you remove bird dropping stains from my paint?',
      answer: 'Yes, in most cases. Bird droppings that have been on the paint for less than a few days can usually be removed cleanly. Older deposits that have dried and etched into the clear coat may leave a permanent mark that requires machine polishing to correct. We always assess and advise before proceeding.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How much does an exterior valet cost in Stockport?',
      answer: 'Exterior valeting in Stockport starts from £65 for a standard hatchback or saloon. Larger vehicles — estates, SUVs, MPVs, and vans — are priced from £75 to £85. Contact us for an exact quote based on your vehicle.',
