      bodyParagraphs: [
        'Interior car valeting is a professional deep-cleaning service focused entirely on the inside of your vehicle. It covers every surface in the cabin: upholstered seats and carpets are vacuumed and treated for stains, hard surfaces including the dashboard, centre console, door cards, and trim are cleaned and conditioned, glass is polished streak-free, and odours are addressed at source rather than masked. The result is a cabin that looks genuinely clean, feels fresh, and is hygienically treated — not just superficially tidied.',
        'Interior valeting is distinct from a basic car tidy. Professional interior valeting uses wet and dry commercial-grade vacuums, steam cleaners for fabric sanitisation, specialist cleaning compounds for each surface type, and anti-bacterial treatments for high-contact areas including the steering wheel, gear lever, and door handles. The tools and techniques are purpose-built for automotive interiors — not domestic products applied to a vehicle.',
        'Interior car valeting is also distinct from interior detailing. Interior valeting is a cleaning and maintenance service — thorough, professional, and transformative. Interior detailing goes further, incorporating hot water extraction for deep upholstery stain removal, leather restoration using specialist conditioners and dyes, UV sanitisation, and odour elimination through ozone treatment. Most vehicles benefit from regular interior valeting with periodic interior detailing when deeper restoration is required.',

      heading: 'Why Stockport Vehicle Interiors Need Regular Professional Attention',
      bodyParagraphs: [
        'Stockport\'s consistently wet climate creates interior contamination challenges that drivers in drier regions do not face to the same degree. Wet footwear tracked in from Greater Manchester\'s pavements and from countryside walks in Marple, Woodbank Park, and Lyme Park transfers significant moisture and organic matter into carpets and under mats. This moisture — often trapped under rubber or fabric mats — promotes bacteria and mould growth in the carpet pile beneath, creating musty odours that worsen over time.',
        'The school run and family use of vehicles across residential areas of Bramhall, Cheadle Hulme, and Hazel Grove results in accumulated food residue, drink spills, crayon, and general daily-use contamination at a rate that far exceeds what casual cleaning can address. A professional interior valet reaches into seat creases, under seats, into door pockets, and along carpet edges that are not accessible to domestic vacuum attachments.',
        'For drivers who spend significant time in their vehicles — daily commuters on the A6, M60, or A560 corridor, sales representatives, or tradespeople — the interior of a car is also a significant working environment. A clean, bacteria-free cabin with conditioned surfaces and clear glass affects the comfort, hygiene, and professional impression of the vehicle. Regular professional interior valeting is a practical investment rather than a cosmetic one.',

    {
      question: 'How long does interior valeting take in Stockport?',
      answer: 'A standard interior valet takes 1.5 to 2.5 hours for a hatchback or saloon. Larger vehicles such as SUVs, estates, and 7-seaters take 2.5 to 3.5 hours. Vehicles with heavy soiling, significant pet hair, or extensive staining may take longer — we always advise at the time of booking.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can you remove stains from my car seats?',
      answer: 'Yes, for most common stains including coffee, food, mud, and most liquid spills. We use specialist automotive upholstery shampoo and targeted stain removers. For deep-set or large-area staining, our upholstery cleaning service using hot water extraction achieves better results. Very old, set-in stains such as permanent ink or dye transfer may not come out completely — we assess and advise on arrival.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you remove pet hair as part of an interior valet?',
      answer: 'We remove surface and accessible pet hair during an interior valet using high-powered vacuuming and rubber brush attachments. For heavily infested vehicles with hair deeply embedded in upholstery weave — particularly long-haired breeds or multiple pets — our dedicated pet hair removal service achieves a more thorough result.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can interior valeting be done in any weather?',
      answer: 'Yes. Because the work is entirely inside the vehicle, interior valeting proceeds in rain, cold, or any weather conditions. This makes it a practical booking for Stockport\'s climate where outdoor work can be weather-dependent.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the difference between interior valeting and interior detailing?',
      answer: 'Interior valeting is a thorough clean and maintenance service covering all surfaces in the cabin. Interior detailing goes further with hot water extraction for deep upholstery restoration, leather re-conditioning and repair, ozone treatment for persistent odours, and UV-C sanitisation. Detailing is a restoration service; valeting is a maintenance service.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How much does interior valeting cost in Stockport?',
      answer: 'Interior valeting in Stockport starts from £80 for a standard hatchback or saloon. Larger vehicles such as SUVs and 7-seaters start from £100. Exact pricing depends on vehicle size and condition — contact us for a quote.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How often should I get my car interior valeted?',
      answer: 'For most drivers, every 6 to 8 weeks is a practical schedule for maintaining a fresh, hygienic interior. Families with young children or pets, and vehicles used daily for commuting, often benefit from monthly interior valeting. A full valet combining interior and exterior is an excellent option every 2 to 3 months.',
