      bodyParagraphs: [
        "Pet hair — particularly from dogs and long-haired cats — embeds itself into fabric upholstery and carpet pile in a way that standard vacuuming cannot address. The microscopic scales on individual hair strands act like barbs, hooking into the woven fibres of car fabric and anchoring the hair below the surface. Static charge compounds this: synthetic fabric and carpet materials hold an electrostatic charge that actively attracts and retains hair against the fibres. A domestic vacuum, even a powerful one, generates suction from above the surface — but the hair is anchored within the pile, and suction alone cannot disengage the barb-and-fibre connection.",
        'Rubber agitation is the key technique. A rubber brush or rubber-tipped tool dragged across fabric creates a localised static effect that lifts embedded hair and rolls it into clumps on the surface, where it can then be vacuumed away. Combined with compressed air to blast hair from crevices and the pressure created by a professional-grade wet/dry vacuum with high suction, this multi-tool approach is the only effective method for deeply embedded pet hair in heavily used vehicles.',

      body: "Stockport's proximity to excellent dog walking locations — Woodbank Park, Reddish Vale, Lyme Park and the Goyt Valley — means many vehicles in the area are regularly used for transporting dogs. Families in Bramhall, Cheadle Hulme, Hazel Grove, and Marple frequently book pet hair removal ahead of selling a vehicle, ahead of passengers using the car, or simply when the accumulation of hair has passed the point a standard valet can effectively address. We are locally based and can often offer same-day or next-day availability for SK postcode customers.",

      question: 'Can you get all the pet hair out?',
      answer:
        'We remove 95–99% of visible pet hair. In very heavily infested vehicles with long-haired breeds, some deeply embedded strands in worn or compressed fabric may remain — we are always honest about realistic expectations before starting. The transformation in all cases is significant.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you also remove pet odours?',
      answer:
        'Pet odour elimination can be added to any pet hair removal service. We use enzyme-based treatments that break down odour-causing compounds rather than masking them, and ozone treatment for persistent smells. See our dedicated odour removal page for full details.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does pet hair removal take in Stockport?',
      answer:
        'Typically 1–2 hours for a standard hatchback or saloon with moderate pet hair. Heavily infested vehicles — long-haired breeds, multiple dogs, or a large boot area — may take 2–3 hours. We always give an honest estimate after assessing the vehicle.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How much does pet hair removal cost in Stockport?',
      answer:
        'Pet hair removal starts from £60 for a standard hatchback. Larger vehicles — estates, SUVs, MPVs — and heavily infested interiors are priced from £80–£100. Contact us for an exact quote.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is pet hair removal different from a standard interior valet?',
      answer:
        'Yes. A standard interior valet includes vacuuming, which removes surface hair but not embedded hair. Our pet hair removal service uses specialist rubber agitation tools, compressed air, and high-suction extraction equipment specifically designed to address hair anchored within fabric weave — something standard vacuuming cannot achieve on its own.',
