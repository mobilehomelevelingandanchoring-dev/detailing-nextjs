      bodyParagraphs: [
        'A full car valet is the most comprehensive cleaning and presentation service available short of professional detailing. It combines a thorough exterior clean — snow foam pre-wash, two-bucket hand wash, wheel decontamination, drying and wax protection — with a comprehensive interior treatment including deep vacuuming, upholstery cleaning, dashboard and trim care, glass cleaning, and odour neutralisation. The result is a vehicle that looks and feels completely fresh, inside and out.',
        'Unlike a mini valet (which is a maintenance service) or an exterior-only wash, a full valet is restorative. It is the service you book when your car has accumulated weeks or months of daily use across Stockport\'s road network and its interior needs proper attention — not just a quick wipe. It is also the standard preparation before private sale, dealer part-exchange, or seasonal refreshes between summer and winter.',
        'SRV Detailing carries out full valets using a mobile, fully self-contained unit. We bring our own water supply, generator, professional equipment, and chemicals. You provide nothing except access to your vehicle. The service is available across all SK postcodes, 7 days a week, at your home or workplace.',

      bodyParagraphs: [
        'Most SRV Detailing customers across Stockport book a full valet two to four times per year — typically at the start of spring (after the salt season), ahead of summer, at the end of summer (to clean up tree sap and pollen), and heading into winter. Between these full valets, a mini valet or maintenance wash every four to six weeks keeps the vehicle in good condition without a full investment of time and cost.',
        'The most common booking triggers are vehicle sale or part-exchange preparation, returning from a long trip or holiday, a seasonal reset after winter, and the point at which the interior has accumulated enough use to need more than a casual clean. A full valet in Stockport is a tangible, same-day transformation — when SRV Detailing leaves your driveway, your car looks substantially different to when we arrived.',

We are based in Dukinfield, meaning we are genuinely local to all of Stockport and can typically arrive within 20 to 30 minutes of the booked time.',

  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'How long does a full valet take in Stockport?',
      answer: '3 to 4 hours for a standard hatchback or saloon in reasonable condition. Larger vehicles — estates, SUVs, MPVs — typically take 4 to 5 hours. Heavily soiled interiors or vehicles with significant staining may require additional time. We always give an honest estimate when booking.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How often should I get a full valet?',
      answer: 'For most Stockport drivers, a full valet every 2 to 3 months is ideal — approximately quarterly. Between full valets, a mini valet every 4 to 6 weeks maintains the vehicle\'s condition efficiently. Drivers on the A6 or M60 daily, or those with children or pets, often benefit from a slightly higher frequency.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the difference between a full valet and car detailing?',
      answer: 'A full valet is a comprehensive cleaning and presentation service — it makes your car look excellent. Professional detailing goes further: it corrects paint defects such as swirl marks and scratches using machine polishing, and applies longer-lasting protection such as ceramic coatings. Detailing is restorative and protective; valeting is maintenance and cleaning. Most vehicles benefit from regular valeting with periodic detailing for paint correction.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can you remove stains from my seats during a full valet?',
      answer: 'Yes, for most common stains. We treat fabric seats with appropriate stain removers and spot-clean affected areas. Deep-set stains, heavy soiling, or large-area contamination may respond better to our dedicated upholstery cleaning service using hot water extraction. We assess each vehicle on arrival and advise on the best approach.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you need water or power from my property?',
      answer: 'No. Our van carries its own fresh water supply and power generator. We are completely self-contained and need nothing from you except safe access to your vehicle and a parking space alongside it.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How much does a full valet cost in Stockport?',
      answer: 'Full valets start from £120 for a standard hatchback or saloon. Larger vehicles — estates, SUVs, MPVs, and vans — start from £150. We provide exact quotes when booking, based on vehicle size and condition. There are no hidden charges or call-out fees for customers within SK postcodes.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is a full valet worth it before selling my car?',
      answer: 'Yes, strongly. A professionally valeted vehicle consistently achieves a better private sale or part-exchange price than an unclean one. First impressions in the car market are powerful — a visibly clean and fresh interior tells a potential buyer the car has been cared for. The cost of a full valet is almost always returned through the improved sale price.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you cover Cheadle Hulme, Bramhall, Marple, and Hazel Grove for full valets?',
      answer: 'Yes. We cover all SK postcodes including Cheadle Hulme (SK8), Bramhall and Hazel Grove (SK7), Marple (SK6), Heaton Moor (SK4), Reddish (SK5), and Stockport town centre (SK1). We are based in Dukinfield and cover the entire Stockport Borough without a travel surcharge.',
