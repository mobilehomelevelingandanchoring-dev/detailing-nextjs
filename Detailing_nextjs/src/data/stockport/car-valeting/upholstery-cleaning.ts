      bodyParagraphs: [
        'Hot water extraction is the professional upholstery cleaning method used in commercial carpet cleaning, hotel furnishings, and vehicle detailing. Heated water mixed with a specialist upholstery cleaning solution is injected at pressure deep into the fabric fibres, where it dissolves and suspends embedded dirt, staining compounds, and bacteria. The machine then immediately extracts the water along with the dissolved contamination, leaving the fabric dramatically cleaner and significantly fresher — not just surface-clean.',
        'The key distinction from steam cleaning alone or spray-and-wipe methods is depth of action. Household upholstery sprays clean the top layer of fibres. Steam can sanitise surfaces but does not extract contamination — it pushes it deeper into the material. Hot water extraction goes into the pile, then pulls everything back out. The result is material that is genuinely clean throughout its depth, not just at the surface. Dry time is typically 2–4 hours in warm conditions, with air movers available to accelerate drying.',

      bodyParagraphs: [
        "Family vehicles across Stockport accumulate upholstery contamination at a rate that routine vacuuming cannot address: children's food and drinks spilled on seats and carpets, muddy footwells from country walks in Marple, Woodbank Park and Reddish Vale, coffee spills during daily commutes on the A6 or A560, and the organic contamination from pet transport all penetrate the fabric weave over time. What appears as a surface stain is often embedded multiple layers deep into the upholstery pile.",
        "Pet owners booking upholstery cleaning alongside our pet hair removal service get a comprehensive interior refresh — hair extracted first, followed by hot water extraction to remove the organic compounds that cause persistent pet odour in the fabric itself. Stockport's wet climate adds a damp element: moisture tracked in on footwear and from wet dogs creates conditions for bacteria and mould growth in carpet pile, particularly under floor mats where ventilation is limited. Hot water extraction removes this bacterial contamination alongside visible staining.",

      question: 'How long do seats and carpets take to dry after hot water extraction?',
      answer:
        'Typically 2–4 hours in warm, ventilated conditions. In colder or more humid Greater Manchester weather, 4–8 hours is more realistic. We use air movers to accelerate drying where possible. Seats can be sat on while slightly damp — we advise on this at the time of service.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can you remove old or set-in stains?',
      answer:
        'Most stains respond well to hot water extraction, including coffee, food, mud, juice, and the majority of common liquid spills. Old set-in stains respond less predictably — many come out completely, some significantly fade, and a small number of permanent compounds (certain inks, dye transfer, chemical bleaching) cannot be reversed. We assess each vehicle on arrival and advise honestly on what to expect.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is hot water extraction safe for all fabric types?',
      answer:
        'Yes — we adjust water temperature, pressure, and cleaning solution concentration for different fabric types including standard automotive fabric, Alcantara, suede-finish cloth, and wool blend materials. We test in an inconspicuous area first before treating any delicate fabric across the full seat.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How much does upholstery cleaning cost in Stockport?',
      answer:
        'Upholstery cleaning starts from £80 for a standard hatchback or saloon. Larger vehicles — estates, SUVs, and 7-seaters — start from £100–£120 depending on the number of rows and surfaces being treated. Contact us for an exact quote.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can upholstery cleaning be combined with other services?',
      answer:
        'Yes — and it often makes sense to do so. Upholstery cleaning is frequently combined with pet hair removal (hair removed first, then extraction), interior valeting (full vacuum and surface clean alongside the extraction), or a full valet. Contact us to discuss a combined service tailored to your vehicle.',
