        'An air freshener masks an odour by layering a stronger scent over the top. The source of the smell — bacteria colonies in carpet pile, smoke residue in the headliner, biological contamination in seat fabric, or mould beneath floor mats — remains completely untouched. Within days or weeks of the air freshener wearing off, the original odour returns, often stronger as the source has had more time to develop. Professional odour removal works differently: we identify and eliminate the source through deep cleaning and, for persistent odours, chemical neutralisation with ozone.',
        "Odour-causing molecules are produced by bacteria and the decomposition of organic material. In a vehicle's interior — a warm, confined space with limited air circulation — bacteria multiply rapidly in soft, porous materials like fabric seats, carpet pile, headliner foam, and door card padding. Standard surface cleaning removes visible contamination but does not penetrate deep enough to address the bacterial source within the material. Professional enzyme-based treatments are formulated to penetrate fabric fibres and break down odour-causing organic compounds at a molecular level, not simply clean the surface above them.",

      heading: 'Why Stockport Vehicles Are Prone to Damp Odours',
      body: "Greater Manchester records over 800mm of annual rainfall — significantly above the national average. Stockport's wet climate means damp is a constant challenge for vehicle interiors: mud and moisture tracked in on footwear from country walks at Woodbank Park, Reddish Vale, or Lyme Park; wet dogs returning from those same walks; and condensation forming inside the cabin on cold mornings and failing to fully dissipate in overcast conditions. Moisture trapped beneath rubber floor mats or in carpet backing provides the conditions for mould and bacteria growth that produces musty, stale smells. Our enzyme treatment and ozone process eliminates this at source rather than covering it.",

  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'Can you completely remove cigarette smoke smell from a car?',
      answer:
        'In most cases, yes. Smoke is one of the most challenging odours because it penetrates every surface including the headliner foam, air conditioning ducting, and every piece of plastic and fabric in the cabin. Our process combines deep cleaning of all surfaces with enzyme treatment and ozone, which reaches areas physical cleaning cannot. Heavily smoked vehicles may require a second treatment session a few days later for complete elimination.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is ozone treatment and is it safe?',
      answer:
        'Ozone (O3) is a powerful oxidising agent that breaks down odour-causing organic molecules at a chemical level — permanently neutralising them rather than masking them. We run an ozone generator inside the sealed vehicle for 30–60 minutes. Ozone dissipates to harmless oxygen within 30 minutes of ventilation. The vehicle should not be occupied during treatment — it is completely safe afterwards and leaves no residue.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does odour removal take?',
      answer:
        '2–4 hours including deep cleaning, enzyme treatment, and ozone cycle. Severe cases — heavy cigarette smoke or long-term pet use — may benefit from a second ozone session 48 hours later. We schedule around your availability.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How much does car odour removal cost in Stockport?',
      answer:
        'Odour removal starts from £70 for a standard vehicle including enzyme treatment. Ozone treatment as an addition is priced based on severity. Contact us for an exact quote — we are locally based and can often offer a prompt appointment across all SK postcodes.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will cleaning alone remove the smell without ozone?',
      answer:
        'For mild odours — light food smells, minor pet hair smell — enzyme-based deep cleaning alone is often sufficient. For embedded smoke, persistent pet odour, damp mould, or biological contamination, ozone treatment is necessary to reach areas within materials and the air circulation system that physical cleaning cannot address. We advise on the appropriate approach based on the specific odour and its severity.',
