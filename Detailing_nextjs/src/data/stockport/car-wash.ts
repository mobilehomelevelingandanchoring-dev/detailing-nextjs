      heading: 'Hand Car Wash vs Automated Car Wash in Stockport',
      body: 'Automated car washes with rotating brushes are convenient but damaging. The brushes trap grit and drag it across your paintwork, creating swirl marks that dull the finish over time. Our mobile hand car wash uses the professional two-bucket method — a wash bucket with pH-neutral shampoo and a separate rinse bucket — so dirt is lifted away safely. Every panel is washed by hand and dried with soft microfibre towels. The result is a consistently cleaner, safer wash every time.',
